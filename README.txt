DXF template files for printable panel underlayments to fit project boxes with
transparent lids.
 https://github.com/oelgern/box_underlays

At e-bay, alliexpress, and other vendors one can purchase quality electronic
 project enclosures with a transparent lid. The price of these enclosures are as
 low as 2 USD delivered to North America. These enclosures can be used with a
 control panel underlayment to produce professional-looking projects. These
 files are templates for the underlayments that fit the known available boxes.

Most boxes are marketed as "waterproof". All boxes must have a transparent top.

Most (all?) boxes have a circular injection mold flash spot, maybe 2-3 mm
 diameter, in the center of the lid. Some of the larger boxes also have eject
 pin marks. Most of these can be removed with a fair bit of sanding and
 polishing.
